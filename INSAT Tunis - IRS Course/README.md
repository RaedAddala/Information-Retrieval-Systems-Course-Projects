# INSAT TUNIS - IRS Course Labs

Alongside the course, the labs focused mostly on building indexs, compression, retrieval, and natural language processing and preprocessing.

In these Labs, I used **python** and **uv**.

This course was taught by [Dr. Ghada Gasmi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=puMNNRQAAAAJ) at [INSAT Tunis](https://insat.rnu.tn/).
